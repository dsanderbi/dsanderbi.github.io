Welcome to my blog! My name is Drazen, and I'm passionate about Business Intelligence (BI) and data analytics.

After completing my initial education, I decided to pursue my interest in mathematics and enrolled in a mathematics degree program. Upon earning my Master's degree in Mathematics, I found myself drawn to the dynamic field of Business Intelligence.

Currently, I work as a BI Developer, where I utilize my analytical skills and mathematical background to extract insights from data, aiding in informed decision-making processes.

Through this blog, I aim to share my knowledge and experiences in the field of BI, focusing on various tools and technologies such as Pentaho Data Integration (PDI), Apache Hop, and many more. Whether you're a seasoned BI professional or just starting out, I hope my blog will provide valuable insights and practical tips to enhance your BI journey.

Join me as we explore the fascinating world of Business Intelligence together!
